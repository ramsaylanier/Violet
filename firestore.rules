      // This rule allows anyone with your database reference to view, edit,
      // and delete all data in your database. It is useful for getting
      // started, but it is configured to expire after 30 days because it
      // leaves your app open to attackers. At that time, all client
      // requests to your database will be denied.
      //
      // Make sure to write security rules for your app before that time, or
      // else all client requests to your database will be denied until you
      // update your rules.
      //
      // Note: This application uses server-side API routes with Firebase Admin SDK
      // which bypasses these security rules. Client-side code does not directly
      // access Firestore. Sensitive token fields (githubToken, googleToken, cloudflareToken)
      // are encrypted server-side and should never be exposed to the client.
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2026, 2, 9);
